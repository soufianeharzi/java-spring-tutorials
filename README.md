# java-tutorials-spring

This repository contains hands-on implementations of the official
[Spring Guides](https://spring.io/guides), along with my detailed architecual breakdowns with easy to undertand explasnations of why "whats going on" and the "why" beghind the cdoe
Each subfolder is a small, focused project generated with Spring Initializr.


## Currently

Spring guide implementations with structured documentation, developer notes, and ADRs.  
Covers REST services, scheduling, and REST client patterns.

| `03-quote-service`         | https://spring.io/guides/gs/consuming-rest/           | Implemented | Backend quote API (self-contained replacement for `quoters`).      |
| `03-spring-consuming-rest` | https://spring.io/guides/gs/consuming-rest/           | Implemented | REST client that consumes the quote-service REST API.              |

More guides will be added over time.

## How to run an example

From a module folder, for example `01-spring-hello-rest`:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

  ## Module layout

  Each module contains:
  
```
  module-name/
  ├── src/main/java/              # Source code
  ├── src/test/java/              # Tests (where applicable)
  ├── docs/
  │   ├── setup/                  # How to create and run the project
  │   ├── concepts/               # Explanations of key classes and patterns
  │   └── reference/              # Original Spring guide (where applicable)
  ├── pom.xml                     # Maven configuration
  └── README.md                   # Overview, quick start, and documentation index
```
  The 03 modules also include:
  
  - `docs/DEVELOPER_NOTES.md`   - Personal notes and detailed 
  - `docs/adr/`                 - Architecture Decision Records documenting the "why" in each design choices



Custom implementations and extensions will be added over time.
This repository is meant to walk through the Spring Boot tutorials, learn best spring practices, and document it all a structured way for reuse.
