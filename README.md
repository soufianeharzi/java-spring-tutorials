This repository contains hands-on implementations of the official
[Spring.io guides](https://spring.io/guides), along with my own notes and explanations.
Each subfolder is a small, focused project generated with Spring Initializr.

More guides will be added over time.

## How to run an example

From a module folder, for example `01-spring-hello-rest`:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

  ## Module layout

  Each module contains:
  
```
  module-name/
  ├── src/main/java/              # Source code
  ├── src/test/java/              # Tests (where applicable)
  ├── docs/
  │   ├── setup/                  # How to create and run the project
  │   ├── concepts/               # Explanations of key classes and patterns
  │   └── reference/              # Original Spring guide (where applicable)
  ├── pom.xml                     # Maven configuration
  └── README.md                   # Overview, quick start, and documentation index
```
  The 03 modules also include:
  
  - `docs/knowledge-summary.md` - Personal notes and takeaways
  - `docs/adr/`                 - Architecture Decision Records documenting design choices



Custom implementations and extensions will be added over time.
This repository is meant to walk through the Spring Boot tutorials and documentation in a structured way.
