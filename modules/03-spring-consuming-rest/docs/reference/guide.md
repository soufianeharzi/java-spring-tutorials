# Consuming a RESTful Web Service with Spring

**Link:** <https://spring.io/guides/gs/consuming-rest/>

This guide walks you through the process of creating an application that consumes a RESTful web
service.

## What You Will Build

You will build an application that uses Spring's RestClient to retrieve a random Spring Boot
quotation at `http://localhost:8080/api/random`.

## What You Need

- About 15 minutes
- A favorite text editor or IDE
- Java 17 or later
- Gradle 7.5+ or Maven 3.5+
- You can also import the code straight into your IDE:
  - Spring Tool Suite (STS)
  - IntelliJ IDEA
  - VSCode

## How to Complete This Guide

Like most Spring Getting Started guides, you can start from scratch and complete each step or you
can bypass basic setup steps that are already familiar to you. Either way, you end up with working
code.

To start from scratch, move on to [Starting with Spring Initializr](#starting-with-spring-initializr).

To skip the basics, do the following:

1. Download and unzip the source repository for this guide, or clone it using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-consuming-rest.git
   ```
2. `cd` into `gs-consuming-rest/initial`
3. Jump ahead to [Fetching a REST Resource](#fetching-a-rest-resource).

When you finish, you can check your results against the code in `gs-consuming-rest/complete`.

## Starting with Spring Initializr

You can use this pre-initialized project and click Generate to download a ZIP file. This project is
configured to fit the examples in this tutorial.

To manually initialize the project:

1. Navigate to <https://start.spring.io>. This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for
   an application and does most of the setup for you.
2. Choose either Gradle or Maven and the language you want to use.
3. Click Dependencies and select **HTTP Client**.
4. Click Generate.
5. Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that is configured
   with your choices.

If your IDE has the Spring Initializr integration, you can complete this process from your IDE.

You can also fork the project from GitHub and open it in your IDE or other editor.

## Fetching a REST Resource

With project setup complete, you can create a simple application that consumes a RESTful service.

Before you can do so, you need a source of REST resources. We have provided an example of such a
service at <https://github.com/spring-guides/quoters>. You can run that application in a separate
terminal and access the result at `http://localhost:8080/api/random`. That address randomly fetches
a quotation about Spring Boot and returns it as a JSON document.

Other valid addresses include:

- `http://localhost:8080/api/` (for all the quotations)
- `http://localhost:8080/api/1` (for the first quotation)
- `http://localhost:8080/api/2` (for the second quotation)
- And so on (up to 10 at present)

If you request that URL through a web browser or curl, you receive a JSON document that looks
something like this:

```json
{
  "type": "success",
  "value": {
    "id": 10,
    "quote": "Really loving Spring Boot, makes stand alone Spring apps easy."
  }
}
```

That is easy enough but not terribly useful when fetched through a browser or through curl.

A more useful way to consume a REST web service is programmatically. To help you with that task,
Spring provides a convenient template class called `RestClient`. `RestClient` makes interacting
with most RESTful services a one-line incantation. And it can even bind that data to custom domain
types.

First, you need to create a domain class, a Java record class or Kotlin data class, to contain the
data that you need. The following listing shows the `Quote` class, which you can use as your domain
class:

```java
package com.example.consumingrest;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnoreProperties;

@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)
public record Quote(String type, Value value) { }
```

The domain class is annotated with `@JsonIgnoreProperties` from the Jackson JSON processing library
to indicate that any properties not bound in this type should be ignored.

To directly bind your data to your custom types, you need to specify the variable name to be
exactly the same as the key in the JSON document returned from the API. In case your variable name
and key in JSON doc do not match, you can use `@JsonProperty` annotation to specify the exact key
of the JSON document. (This example matches each variable name to a JSON key, so you do not need
that annotation here.)

You also need an additional domain class to embed the inner quotation itself. The `Value` class
fills that need, as the following listing shows:

```java
package com.example.consumingrest;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnoreProperties;

@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)
public record Value(Long id, String quote) { }
```

This uses the same annotations but maps onto other data fields.

## Finishing the Application

The Initializr creates a class with a `main()` method, as the following listing shows:

```java
package com.example.consumingrest;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class ConsumingRestApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ConsumingRestApplication.class, args);
    }

}
```

Now you need to add a few other things to the `ConsumingRestApplication` class to get it to show
quotations from our RESTful source. You need to add:

- A logger, to send output to the log (the console, in this example).
- A `CommandLineRunner` that builds a `RestClient` instance with the auto-configured
  `RestClient.Builder` and uses it to fetch our quotation on startup.

The following listing shows the finished `ConsumingRestApplication` class:

```java
package com.example.consumingrest;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import org.springframework.boot.ApplicationRunner;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Profile;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestClient;

@SpringBootApplication
public class ConsumingRestApplication {

    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ConsumingRestApplication.class);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ConsumingRestApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    @Profile("!test")
    public ApplicationRunner run(RestClient.Builder builder) {
        RestClient restClient = builder.baseUrl("http://localhost:8080").build();
        return args -> {
            Quote quote = restClient
                    .get().uri("/api/random")
                    .retrieve()
                    .body(Quote.class);
            log.info(quote.toString());
        };
    }
}
```

## Running the Application

You can run the application from the command line with Gradle or Maven. You can also build a single
executable JAR file that contains all the necessary dependencies, classes, and resources and run
that. Building an executable jar makes it easy to ship, version, and deploy the service as an
application throughout the development lifecycle, across different environments, and so forth.

If you use Gradle, you can run the application by using `./gradlew bootRun`. Alternatively, you can
build the JAR file by using `./gradlew build` and then run the JAR file, as follows:

```bash
java -jar build/libs/gs-consuming-rest-0.1.0.jar
```

If you use Maven, you can run the application by using `./mvnw spring-boot:run`. Alternatively, you
can build the JAR file with `./mvnw clean package` and then run the JAR file, as follows:

```bash
java -jar target/gs-consuming-rest-0.1.0.jar
```

The steps described here create a runnable JAR. You can also build a classic WAR file.

You should see output similar to the following but with a random quotation:

```
2019-08-22 14:06:46.506  INFO 42940 --- [           main] c.e.c.ConsumingRestApplication           : Quote{type='success', value=Value{id=1, quote='Working with Spring Boot is like pair-programming with the Spring developers.'}}
```

If you see an error that reads, `Could not extract response: no suitable HttpMessageConverter found
for response type [class com.example.consumingrest.Quote]`, it is possible that you are in an
environment that cannot connect to the backend service (which sends JSON if you can reach it).
Maybe you are behind a corporate proxy. Try setting the `http.proxyHost` and `http.proxyPort`
system properties to values appropriate for your environment.

## Summary

Congratulations! You have just developed a simple REST client by using Spring Boot.
